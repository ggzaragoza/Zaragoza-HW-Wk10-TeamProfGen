## Description
In this repository you will find files for a team profile generator that receives user input via the command line and, via Node.js, will output a basic HTML file assembled with the help of the 'inquirer' package. This application would ideally be implemented in the workplace to assist managers in easily compiling their team members' information and contacts.

## Installation
The application may be forked from this repository. Once inside the folder on your local computer, run an NPM install and then install the 'inquirer' package for this application to run.
## Usage
This application will first ask for the team manager's name, employee ID, email address, and office number. Once the manager's info is entered, the application will provide the option to add additional team members, either engineers or interns. Prompts for these options will ask for the engineers' GitHub usernames, or which schools the interns currently attend. The third option will exit the application and generate an HTML file with the team's information.
